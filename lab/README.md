## Directory Organization

This directory is designed to be flat and contain directories with
rather long names (<66) for the sake web SEO and to be able to search
simply through directory names to do a poor-man's search (even though
everything should be linked several times from the KEG dex as well).

Notably, directories are not used to categorize anything. This is
because any given lab might span multiple categories that are better
organized as tags/labels.
