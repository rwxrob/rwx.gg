*In 2021, I no longer believe that GitLab is best. [GitHub has blown them
away](/advice/usegithub/).*

GitLab is the recommended Git hosting provider for this course. GitLab provides an objectively better service and gives back far more to the community than GitHub. All of us are all still required to have [GitHub](../../github/) accounts to stay connected to the 10 million legacy users stuck on it but use GitLab to host your repos, public and private.
