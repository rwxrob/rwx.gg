The *Dunning-Kruger Effect* generally refers to not knowing that you don't know. Or worse, being convinced you know something you actually have no clue about. Put another way, it is a [cognitive bias](/what/learning/cognitive/bias/) that leads to people of low ability thinking they are superior without realizing they're not. 

The opposite of Dunning-Kruger is [impostor syndrome](/what/learning/cognitive/impostor/), which is much more benign than DK.
