Title: What are Daemons?
Subtitle: Your Server Servants
Query: true

A daemon is a lesser demon that does the bidding of its master, which is exactly what a running program that listens for requests and commands is in the UNIX/Linux world. You will notice some programs have a `d` after them, such as `sshd`, which is not the same as `ssh`. The first is the thing that you connect to. The later the client program that does the connecting.

There have actually been Christian groups organize protests against BSD because of the reference to daemons and 'kill'ing things.
