# Annual (May the Fourth) Beginner Boost

The annual SKILSTAK Beginner Boost helps new and existing technologists
discover what they don't know, decide for themselves what they should
learn, prepare a personal learning plan, and follow through on it.

## When is it? How long is it?

Boosts always start on May the 4th and end July 31st. Each week focuses
on a different general group of skills and concepts. Weeks are divided
into weekday [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/rwxrob) sessions that generally
run from 3-5:30pm US Eastern time (but are also recorded). Weekends are
other times during the day are free but usually there is a coworking
stream to keep you company.

## What do I need to know before I begin?

Boosts are for beginners. Very little is assumed about what you know.
Nevertheless, you must be able to do the following before beginning:

* Read and write English 
* Type and use a mouse or touchpad (touch typing is not required, but
  definitely preferred and eventually required)
* Use the Internet Web browsing and email
* Watch Twitch live streams and/or YouTube videos

## What will I learn?

First, you'll learn how to learn. Then, if you like, you can choose to
learn what we think you should to become and remain a good, modern
technologist. Others might have vastly different ideas about what you
should learn, which is why the priority is helping you make your own
choices and plans. We aren't here to tell you what to do, just tell you
what you *can* do.

## Will I get a job? What kind of job?

Boosts focus on the following potential careers, but remember, this is
just a boost to get you headed in the right direction and with a little
motivational velocity:

* UNIX/Linux Infrastructure Engineer, System Administrator
* Cloud Native Administrator, Engineer, and Developer
* Site Reliability Engineer, Systems Software Developer
* DevOps Specialist, Engineer, Developer
* Cybersecurity Pentester, Engineer
* Embedded/Edge Engineer, Developer
* Backend Web Developer

The list above is used to decide what content to include in the boost.
If a technology or concept does not apply to every career listed it is
left out.

## Why just these jobs?

According to labour department statistics these careers fulfill the
greatest need for technology and as such provide the most opportunity,
compensation, and stability. Besides that, we think they're the most
fun.

## What does it cost?

Nothing but your time and commitment. We do appreciate your
sponsorship, subscriptions, purchases, and gifts, however. All your
financial help goes back into making things better for the next boost.

## Why are you doing this?

Because I care. The world of skills education is full of reasons to get
angry. I choose to get busy instead. Don't get mad, get busy.

## Why are you angry?

Because more people need to realize that you don't need permission,
money, school, or any "teacher" to learn. *You* are the boss of your own
learning. *You* are your own best "teacher." *You* can prepare your own
plan and learn to assess yourself. 

Humans have been learning successfully this way for thousands of years
but others have fought to destroy this method and idea, to
institutionalize and industrialize our learning in a way that the ruling
elite *want* despite what is in everyone's best interest. We've come so
far from *true* learning that Socrates wouldn't recognize anything that
is happening today.

College tuition costs continue to skyrocket while the value of the
learning provided plummets. Some are adding E-Sports teams to lure more
students while doing *nothing* to modernize what is learned. None
"teach" anything about *how to learn*. Those who learn are more
survivors than graduates. While students drop out with crushing debt and
little to show for it tenured professors face zero accountability.

As Paulo Friere describes so well in [Pedagogy of the Oppressed](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=Pedagogy of the Oppressed) we
have been subjected from our earliest years to a level of oppression
and, as Ken Thompson says, have had our creativity "beaten out of us."
This *must* to stop for humanity to truly progress. Those who learn to
learn despite this frustrating system seem to have something magical
about them. It's not magic. It's nature. Autodidactic learning is far
more valuable, sustainable, and easy to provide. But we have to fight
for it. We don't need no education. We don't need no thought control.
And we don't need permission. We *will* learn despite the system.
