  <h2 id=subtitle>Invented by Writers, Not Scientists</h2>
  <p>Markdown is a simple <a href="/what/markup/">markup</a> language invented by writers who didn’t want to write <a href="/lang/html/">HTML</a>. Markdown has become the standard for most technical writing and is supported on Reddit, StackExchange, Discord, GitLab, GitHub, and pretty much everywhere else.</p>

  <p>Modern companies such as GitLab depend <em>heavily</em> on Markdown for everything they do. Watch any of their release conference videos to see examples of all the documentation and presentations that make extensive use of Markdown (specifically <a href="/lang/md/common/">CommonMark</a> since GitLab as an organization does not have a need for the Math and other advantages of Pandoc Markdown.)</p>

  <h2 id="types-of-markdown">Types of Markdown</h2>
  <p>Eventually you’ll want to use <a href="/lang/md/pandoc/">Pandoc Markdown</a> for everything. (In fact, <a href="https://gitlab.com/rwx.gg/README/-/tree/master/md">this document</a> is written in it.) Pandoc Markdown is far and away the most powerful, sustainable, and supported format for capturing knowledge source, which is why the R language project adopted it as their language documentation format.</p>
  <p>However, you can learn <a href="/lang/md/basic/">basic Pandoc Markdown</a> in less than 30 minutes and it will work <em>everywhere</em>.</p>
  <p>Why the differences?</p>
  <p>The original Markdown was never standardized and has evolved into more than a dozen different flavors many of which are incompatible with one another. Thankfully there are only three versions that really matter:</p>
  <h2 id="standard-knowledge-source-language">Standard Knowledge Source Language</h2>
  <p>Markdown has become the closest thing to a universal standard for writing all documentation today. In addition, authors write entire textbooks and novels in Markdown these days. When combined with a tool like <a href="/tools/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> your Markdown can be converted to <em>every other format on the planet</em>. Markdown is the <em>only</em> markup writing language that can claim this. Therefore, <em>everyone</em> should learn it from those needing a solid, sustainable way to take notes, to those creating entire <a href="/what/knowledge/base/">knowledge bases</a>. Ironically Markdown is practically not taught at all today in any educational setting.</p>

  <h2 id="what-about-wikis">What about wikis?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://duck.com/lite?kae=t&amp;q=All%20wiki%20languages">All wiki languages</a> are at least as complicated as HTML to learn. It’s no surprise that they were invented by programmers and not writers, like Markdown was. <a href="/what/wikis/">Wikis</a> obviously do have a place, however.</p>
  <h2 id="what-about-latex">What about LaTeX?</h2>
  <p>It is fully supported by <a href="/lang/md/pandoc/">Pandoc Markdown</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="what-about-restructuredtext">What about reStructuredText?</h2>
  <p>You didn’t really ask that, did you?</p>
  <p>RST lost because it is so damn horrible and idiotically designed. Clearly the creators had nothing but documenting Python code in mind when they designed it.</p>
