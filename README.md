# SKILSTAK RWX.GG Open Knowledge Project

*You may be looking for the old [rwx.gg source] from which this cleaner
version is being built.*

[rwx.gg source]: <https://github.com/rwxrob/rwx.gg/tree/old>

This repo will contain the [KEG content](https://keg.sh) (in [keg](keg)) for
[rwx.gg](https://rwx.gg), an [open knowledge
project](https://rwx.gg/terms/open-knowledge-project). (The web content
is actually generated by the [gen](gen) script and placed into the
[docs](docs) directory as required to publish to [GitHub Pages](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=GitHub Pages).)

> Note that this content was once hosted on Netlify but this extra layer
of complexity and dependency is no longer needed.
