Everything is a file in Unix/Linux, even your mouse, screen, keyboard, and running [processes](/what/process/). All of those files and directories are organized in a standard way for all Linux and most Unix systems. The standard is called the *Linux file Hierarchy* or LFH. Understanding it will keep you out of places you might not want to be and help you potentially find people hiding there.
